# Model Cards

**Standardized Documentation for AI Models**

> "If you can't document it, you shouldn't deploy it."

---

## 📋 Overview

Model Cards provide standardized documentation for AI models deployed in KOSMOS. They ensure transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making about model usage, limitations, and ethical considerations.

### Purpose

Model Cards serve to:
- **Document performance** across different scenarios and demographics
- **Disclose limitations** and known failure modes
- **Enable informed decisions** about model appropriateness
- **Meet compliance requirements** (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO 42001)
- **Facilitate model governance** and lifecycle management

## 🧪 Model Card Validation

### Automated Checks

```python
# Validate model card completeness
def validate_model_card(card_path: str) -> ValidationResult:
    card = load_model_card(card_path)
    
    # Required fields
    assert card.model_id, "Model ID missing"
    assert card.version, "Version missing"
    assert card.intended_use, "Intended use missing"
    assert card.training_data, "Training data description missing"
    assert card.performance_metrics, "Performance metrics missing"
    assert card.limitations, "Limitations missing"
    assert card.ethical_review_date, "Ethics review missing"
    
    # Performance metrics validation
    for metric in card.performance_metrics:
        assert metric.value is not None
        assert metric.confidence_interval is not None
        assert metric.test_set_size > 0
    
    # Fairness metrics (required for high-risk models)
    if card.risk_level == "high":
        assert card.fairness_metrics, "Fairness metrics required for high-risk models"
    
    return ValidationResult(passed=True)
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

### Model Card Tools

```python
# Generate model card from training metadata
from model_card_toolkit import ModelCardToolkit

mct = ModelCardToolkit()
model_card = mct.scaffold_assets()
model_card.model_details.name = "Document Summarizer"
model_card.model_details.version = "v2.1.0"
# ... fill in details
mct.update_model_card(model_card)
mct.export_format()  # Generate HTML/PDF
```

### Fairness Evaluation

```python
# Calculate fairness metrics
from aequitas.group import Group
from aequitas.plotting import Plot

# Load predictions and demographics
df = load_model_predictions()

# Calculate disparate impact
g = Group()
xtab, _ = g.get_crosstabs(df)
fairness = g.get_disparity_predefined_groups(xtab)

# Check if passes fairness threshold
assert fairness.all_disparity_ratios() > 0.8
```

### Performance Tracking

```python
# Track model performance over time
from model_monitor import PerformanceTracker

tracker = PerformanceTracker(model_id="MC-001")
tracker.log_prediction(input_data, prediction, ground_truth)
tracker.calculate_metrics(window="7d")
tracker.check_drift()
```
