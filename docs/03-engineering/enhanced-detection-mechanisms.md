# Enhanced Detection Mechanisms

## Purpose
This document outlines the enhanced detection mechanisms to be implemented in the KOSMOS system.

## Advanced Threat Detection Methods
1. Machine learning-based anomaly detection
2. Behavioral analysis for user and system activities
3. Integration with threat intelligence feeds
4. Enhanced log analysis and correlation

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and selection of appropriate tools and technologies
2. Integration of new detection methods into existing security infrastructure
3. Configuration and tuning of detection algorithms
4. Testing and validation of new detection mechanisms

## Responsibilities
- Security Team: Researching and implementing new detection methods
- Development Team: Assisting with integration and configuration
- Project Management: Overseeing the implementation process

## Timeline
- Research and planning: 2 weeks
- Implementation: 4 weeks
- Testing and validation: 2 weeks

## Metrics for Success
- Reduction in mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Reduction in mean time to respond (MTTR)
- Increase in detection accuracy
