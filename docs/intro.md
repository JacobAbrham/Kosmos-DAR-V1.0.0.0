# KOSMOS Living Constitution

Welcome to the **KOSMOS AI-Native Operating System** documentation - your single source of truth for governance, architecture, engineering, operations, and human factors.

## Core Philosophy

> "If it isn't in the repo, it doesn't exist. If it isn't automated, it is out of date."

This is a **Living Documentation** system:
- ✅ **Immutable** - All decisions tracked via Git history
- ✅ **Auditable** - Complete traceability from source to deployment
- ✅ **Automated** - CI/CD-driven updates, not manual editing
- ✅ **Compliant** - NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, EU AI Act aligned
