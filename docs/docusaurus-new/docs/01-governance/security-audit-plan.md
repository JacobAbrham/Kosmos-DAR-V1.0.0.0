# Security Audit Plan

## Purpose
This document outlines the plan for conducting regular security audits and penetration testing for the KOSMOS project.

## Scope
The security audit will cover all components of the KOSMOS system, including:
- Application code
- Infrastructure configuration
- Data storage and processing
- Network communications

## Frequency
Security audits will be conducted:
- Quarterly for routine assessments
- After major updates or changes to the system
- In response to security incidents

## Methodology
1. Pre-audit preparation:
   - Review of system documentation
   - Identification of critical assets
   - Selection of audit tools and techniques

2. Audit execution:
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Configuration review
   - Code review
   - Penetration testing

3. Post-audit activities:
   - Reporting of findings
   - Prioritization of remediation efforts
   - Verification of fixes

## Tools and Techniques
- Vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Static and dynamic code analysis tools
- Configuration compliance scanners
- Penetration testing frameworks (e.g., Metasploit)

## Reporting and Remediation
- Audit findings will be documented in a comprehensive report
- Findings will be prioritized based on severity and risk
- Remediation efforts will be tracked to completion

## Responsibilities
- Security Team: Conducting audits and reporting findings
- Development Team: Remediating identified issues
- Project Management: Overseeing the audit process and ensuring remediation efforts

## Continuous Improvement
- Lessons learned from each audit will be incorporated into future audits
- The audit plan will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
