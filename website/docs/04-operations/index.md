## 🎯 Operational Principles

### 1. **Observe Everything**
Comprehensive monitoring is the foundation of reliable operations.

### 2. **Fail Gracefully**
Systems should degrade predictably with clear error messages.

### 3. **Automate Recovery**
Automated remediation reduces mean time to recovery (MTTR).

### 4. **Budget Consciously**
AI operations can be expensive. Track and optimize costs continuously.

### 5. **Learn from Incidents**
Every incident is an opportunity to improve systems and processes.

### 6. **Test Disaster Recovery**
Regular chaos engineering and disaster recovery drills are essential.
