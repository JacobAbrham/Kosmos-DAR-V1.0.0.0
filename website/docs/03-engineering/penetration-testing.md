# Penetration Testing

## Purpose
This document outlines the process for integrating penetration testing into the KOSMOS development cycle.

## Scope
Penetration testing will be conducted:
- After major updates or changes to the system
- As part of the quarterly security audits
- In response to security incidents

## Methodology
1. Planning:
   - Identify test scope and objectives
   - Select test team and tools

2. Testing:
   - Network penetration testing
   - Application penetration testing
   - API penetration testing

3. Reporting:
   - Document findings and recommendations
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

## Tools and Techniques
- Penetration testing frameworks (e.g., Metasploit)
- Commercial penetration testing tools
- Custom scripts for specific testing needs

## Integration with Development Cycle
- Penetration testing will be included in the CI/CD pipeline
- Automated tests will be run on each major release
- Manual testing will be performed quarterly and after major changes

## Responsibilities
- Security Team: Conducting penetration testing
- Development Team: Remediating identified issues
- Project Management: Overseeing the testing process

## Continuous Improvement
- Lessons learned from each test will be incorporated into future tests
- The testing process will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed
