## 🎯 Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Pull Request Review** - Automated code review suggestions
2. **Security Analysis** - Identify potential vulnerabilities
3. **Style Compliance** - Check adherence to coding standards
4. **Performance Tips** - Suggest optimizations

### Supported Languages

| Language | Support Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Python | ⭐⭐⭐ Full | Primary focus |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | ⭐⭐⭐ Full | Including React/Node.js |
| Java | ⭐⭐ Good | Spring Boot focus |
| Go | ⭐⭐ Good | Idiomatic suggestions |
| C# | ⭐⭐ Good | .NET patterns |
| Rust | ⭐ Basic | Limited coverage |

### Out-of-Scope Applications

- ❌ Automated code fixes without human review
- ❌ Security-critical vulnerability patching
- ❌ Legacy COBOL/Fortran review
- ❌ Real-time IDE integration (latency constraints)

## 📚 Training Data

### Dataset Composition

| Source | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Internal Code Reviews | 100,000 reviews | Historical PR reviews |
| Open Source Reviews | 500,000 reviews | GitHub public reviews |
| Security Advisories | 50,000 examples | CVE-linked code samples |
| Style Guides | 1,000 docs | Major style guide rules |

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Anonymization** - Removed author/org identifiers
2. **Deduplication** - Removed duplicate reviews
3. **Quality Filtering** - Only accepted/merged reviews
4. **Syntax Validation** - Ensured valid code samples

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Risks

### Known Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Frequency | Mitigation |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| False security alerts | ~8% | Severity scoring, human review |
| Language version mismatch | ~5% | Version specification in config |
| Framework-specific misses | ~10% | Framework-aware prompting |
| Over-optimization suggestions | ~6% | Readability priority flag |

### Bias Considerations

- Favors popular coding patterns (may miss valid alternatives)
- Open-source style bias (may not match enterprise conventions)
- English-centric comments and documentation

### Risk Mitigations

1. **Severity Tiers** - Critical issues flagged, minor suggestions optional
2. **Confidence Scoring** - Low-confidence reviews marked
3. **Human Override** - All suggestions require human approval
4. **Audit Trail** - Full logging of all reviews

---

## ✅ Ethical Considerations

### Fairness Analysis

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Language Bias | Low | Multi-language training |
| Style Preference | Medium | May favor certain patterns |
| Authorship Bias | None | Fully anonymized |

### Privacy Considerations

- Code snippets not stored post-inference
- No training on proprietary code without consent
- API logs retained for 30 days only

### Environmental Impact

- **Carbon Footprint:** N/A (API-based)
- **Token Optimization:** Chunked reviews reduce usage
